        <p> Hi! My name is Mikaela and this is my Portfolio! On this web page you will learn a little bit about my life, my interests, and most importantly my work.
            Lets start with my education! I have a Bachelor of Science in Family and Consumer Science. Totally unrelated to my current position as an HRIS Administrator and totally different in regards to my current ambitions.
            What can I say? I love to learn about various topics and my interests are so diverse that it has provided me the opportunity to gain experience and exposure to what I really want do in the future.</p>
            
        <p> As far as the future, I share that with my husband, in which we have almost been married for a year as of July 3rd. We've been together for 6 years after being friends in high school and dating in college. 
            He is my best friend and totally supportive of everything I want to do in life such as continuing my education, traveling, and maybe letting me convince him of adding more puppies into our lives.</p>

        <p></p>We currently have one dog named Kobe. I let my husband believe that we named him after the basketball player, but I just simply adored the name. 
            He is now a 3 year old morkie (maltese/yorkie mix) that has the energy of the commercialized energetic bunny and a heart of gold. 
            He's so sweet, but he also has a very terror.. I mean terrier side of him that often gets him in trouble and missing out on additional treats. Don't let that fool you though, he is extremely spoiled.
            The things I enjoy most in life are spending time with my loved ones, dancing, reading, traveling, and learning new things.
            I absolutely love all things that are creative! Art, Music, Dance, Design, etc! There is so much inspiration in the world and being able to use that platform as a developer is so exciting!
        </p>
